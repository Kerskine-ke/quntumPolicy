# AI-Driven Quantum Resource Allocator

This research prototype uses a neural network policy model to intelligently assign quantum tasks to topological vs. non-topological qubits based on noise sensitivity and node reliability.

## Features
- TensorFlow-based neural net policy model
- Task-to-node scheduling with AI decision making
- Simulated node failure and system rebalancing
- Visualization of performance metrics

## Usage
```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
python quantum_allocator_demo.py
